<h1>:dragon_face: Hey, I’m Drew! :volcano:</h1>
I'm a fullstack developer based out of Brooklyn, New York. Proficient in React, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails with a zeal for creative problem solving. A problem is just 
progress that hasn't happened yet.
<br><br>
I love to build things or break things and then make them better. I approach building code in the same way I approach building a song or rebuilding vintage mopeds. 
It should be easily understood, efficient, fast, and designed with future modifications in mind.
